GreyOS is a new kind of OS, a Meta-OS.

GreyOS introduces a new era of unimited possibilities with the concept of Cloud Computer (CC). GreyOS is still under rigorous development 
and not a final system to be deployed for business purposes. Ths CC is the next generation of computing but highly experimental for now.
GreyOS is based on the latest [micro-MVC](https://github.com/g0d/micro-MVC) and supported by various developers across the globe.

For detailed information on GreyOS you may check the [White Paper](https://github.com/g0d/GreyOS/blob/master/Tech%20Doc/GreyOS%20-%20Era%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Computer%20(White%20Paper).pdf) and the [Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g0d/GreyOS/master/Misc/GreyOS%20-%20Architecture.png).
